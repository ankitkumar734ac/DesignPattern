/*

 * communicate with each other.

/**
 * The Mediator design pattern offers several advantages and has a few
 * drawbacks. Let's discuss the pros and cons:
 * 
 * Pros:
 * 
 * 1. Decoupling of components: The Mediator pattern promotes loose coupling
 * between components by removing direct dependencies. Each component only needs
 * to know about the Mediator interface, not the other components, reducing the
 * complexity and dependencies within the system.
 * 
 * 2. Centralized control: The Mediator pattern provides a central point of
 * control and coordination. The mediator encapsulates the communication logic
 * and behavior, making it easier to manage and modify the interactions between
 * components.
 * 
 * 3. Simplified communication: Components communicate through the Mediator,
 * which simplifies their communication channels. They don't need to know the
 * details of each other, reducing the complexity of direct communication
 * between components.
 * 
 * 4. Improved maintainability: The Mediator pattern enhances the
 * maintainability of the system. Since components are decoupled, making changes
 * or adding new components becomes easier without impacting the existing
 * components.
 * 
 * 5. Reusability: The Mediator can be reused across different components and
 * scenarios. It provides a common interface for communication, making it
 * adaptable to various use cases.
 * 
 * Cons:
 * 
 * 1. Increased complexity of the Mediator: As the number of components and
 * their interactions grow, the Mediator can become complex, managing numerous
 * communication channels. It may require careful design and maintenance to
 * avoid the Mediator becoming a "god object" with too many responsibilities.
 * 
 * 2. Performance impact: The Mediator pattern can introduce a performance
 * overhead, especially if there are frequent and complex communications between
 * components. The indirect communication through the Mediator may introduce
 * additional latency compared to direct communication.
 * 
 * 3. Limited scalability: The Mediator pattern may face challenges when new
 * components need to be added or when the system becomes highly dynamic. As the
 * number of components increases, the Mediator can become a bottleneck,
 * managing the communication between all entities.
 * 
 * 4. Increased code complexity: Implementing the Mediator pattern requires
 * additional classes and interfaces, which may increase the overall code
 * complexity of the system.
 * 
 * Overall, the Mediator pattern is beneficial in scenarios where the
 * interactions between components need to be loosely coupled and centralized.
 * However, careful consideration should be given to the system's complexity, //
 * * scalability, and performance requirements when applying this pattern.
