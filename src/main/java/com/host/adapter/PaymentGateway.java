/**
 * The Adapter design pattern is used in scenarios where there is a need to make two incompatible interfaces work together.
 *  Here are a few scenarios where you would apply the Adapter design pattern:
 * 1.Integrating third-party components: When you need to integrate third-party components or libraries into your system, 
 * they may have their own interfaces that don't match your existing codebase. By creating an adapter, you can bridge the 
 * gap between the third-party component's interface and your system's interface, allowing them to work together seamlessly.
 * 
 * 2.Legacy system integration: When you have a legacy system that uses outdated interfaces, and you want to incorporate 
 * new components or services with modern interfaces, the Adapter pattern can be used to adapt the new interfaces to the 
 * legacy system's interface. This allows the legacy system to leverage the functionalities of the new components without 
 * the need for extensive modifications.
 * 
 * 3.Reusing existing code: In situations where you have existing code that provides useful functionality but doesn't match
 *  the required interface, you can create an adapter to adapt that code to the desired interface. This allows you to reuse 
 *  the existing code and integrate it into your system without the need for significant changes.
 *  
 * 4.Interface standardization: In a system with multiple subsystems or modules that have different interfaces, you can use 
 * the Adapter pattern to standardize the interfaces and make them consistent across the system. Adapters can be created for
 *  each subsystem or module to adapt their specific interfaces to a common interface, simplifying the communication and 
 *  interaction between different components.
 *  
 * 5.Testing and mocking: Adapters are useful for testing purposes. You can create mock adapters that implement the required
 *  interface and simulate different behaviors or scenarios, allowing you to test the behavior of other components without 
 *  relying on the actual implementations. This helps in isolating and testing individual components in a controlled manner.
 * 
 * Overall, the Adapter design pattern is used to achieve interoperability and bridge the gap between incompatible interfaces,
 * allowing different components or systems to work together effectively without extensive modifications or rewriting of existing code.
