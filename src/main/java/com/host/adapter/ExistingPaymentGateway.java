There is a class called ExistingPaymentGateway that implements the PaymentGateway interface. 
It provides a concrete implementation of the processPayment method, 
which performs the payment processing using the existing payment gateway.

Pros of the Adapter design pattern:

Enhanced code reusability: Adapters allow you to reuse existing code or integrate third-party components with incompatible interfaces into your system without making significant modifications. This promotes code reuse and avoids duplicating functionality.

Improved maintainability: By encapsulating the conversion logic within the adapter, any changes or updates to the underlying interfaces or implementations can be localized within the adapter class. This simplifies maintenance and reduces the impact on the rest of the codebase.

Seamless integration: The Adapter pattern enables the integration of components with mismatched interfaces, allowing them to work together smoothly. It bridges the gap between different systems or modules, promoting interoperability and enabling them to collaborate effectively.

Flexibility and extensibility: Adapters provide a layer of abstraction that decouples the client code from the specific implementations. This allows for flexibility in swapping or adding new adapters to adapt different implementations or integrate new components without affecting the existing code.

Cons of the Adapter design pattern:

Increased complexity: The introduction of adapters adds an extra layer of complexity to the codebase. This can make the code harder to understand, especially when multiple adapters are involved.

Potential performance impact: Adapters may introduce a small performance overhead due to the extra layer of indirection involved in translating between interfaces. However, this impact is typically negligible unless performance is critical in the specific context.

Additional code and maintenance: The creation and maintenance of adapter classes require additional code. If there are multiple adapters in the system, it can lead to an increased number of classes, which may require ongoing maintenance and increase the overall complexity of the codebase.

Possible tight coupling: Depending on the design choices, adapters may become tightly coupled to specific implementations or components. This can reduce the flexibility to switch implementations or introduce new adapters, potentially leading to a less modular design.

It's important to consider these pros and cons in the context of your specific application and design requirements when deciding whether to use the Adapter design pattern.
