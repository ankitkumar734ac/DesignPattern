 * How to implement a Observer pattern in an exited example?
 * 
 * To implement the Observer pattern in an existing example, you need to
 * identify the subject (observable) and the observers, and modify the code
 * accordingly to establish the communication between them. Here's a
 * step-by-step guide on how to add the Observer pattern to an existing example:
 * 
 * Identify the Subject: Determine the class or component that will act as the
 * subject (observable). This is the entity whose state changes need to be
 * observed by other components.
 * 
 * Create the Subject Interface: Define an interface that represents the
 * subject. This interface should include methods for registering, removing, and
 * notifying observers.
 * 
 * Implement the Subject: Implement the subject interface in the subject class.
 * Maintain a list of observers and provide methods to register, remove, and
 * notify observers based on the state changes.
 * 
 * Identify the Observers: Identify the classes or components that need to
 * observe the state changes of the subject.
 * 
 * Create the Observer Interface: Define an interface that represents the
 * observer. This interface should include a method for updating the observer
 * when the subject's state changes.
 * 
 * Implement the Observers: Implement the observer interface in the observer
 * classes. The update method should specify how the observer should react to
 * the subject's state changes.
 * 
 * Establish Communication: In the existing code, identify the points where the
 * subject's state changes occur. At those points, call the notifyObservers
 * method on the subject to notify all registered observers.
 * 
 * Register Observers: In the existing code, identify the appropriate places
 * where observers should be registered with the subject. Call the
 * registerObserver method on the subject to register the observers.
 * 
 * With these steps in mind, you can proceed to implement the Observer pattern
 * in your existing example. Adapt the code based on the specific context and
 * requirements of your example.
