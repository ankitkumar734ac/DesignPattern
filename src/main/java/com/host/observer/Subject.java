 * Yes, it is possible to break the Observer pattern if not implemented
 * correctly. Here are a few ways the pattern can be inadvertently broken:
 * 
 * 1. Inconsistent State: If the subject (observable) does not maintain a
 * consistent state or fails to notify observers appropriately, the observers
 * may receive incorrect or outdated information. It is crucial to ensure that
 * the subject updates its state before notifying observers and that the
 * information provided to observers is accurate.
 * 
 * 2. Uncontrolled Observers: If observers are not managed properly, there can
 * be issues. For instance, if observers are not properly registered or removed,
 * they may not receive updates or continue to receive updates even after being
 * removed. It is important to manage observer registration and removal
 * correctly to ensure proper functioning of the pattern.
 * 
 * 3. Tight Coupling: If observers have direct dependencies on the subject, the
 * pattern's loose coupling principle can be violated. Observers should depend
 * only on the subject's interface, and the subject should not have explicit
 * knowledge of specific observer implementations. Tight coupling can make the
 * code less flexible and harder to maintain.
 * 
 * 4. Performance and Efficiency: If the subject frequently notifies observers
 * even when there are no significant changes in the state, it can lead to
 * unnecessary processing and performance issues. It is important to optimize
 * the notification mechanism and only notify observers when there is a
 * meaningful change in the state.
 * 
 * 5. Thread Safety: In a multithreaded environment, concurrent modifications to
 * the subject's state or the observer list can lead to data inconsistencies and
 * synchronization problems. It is crucial to ensure proper synchronization
 * mechanisms are in place to maintain thread safety.
 * 
 * To prevent breaking the Observer pattern, it is essential to adhere to the
 * principles and guidelines of the pattern, such as ensuring consistency,
 * proper registration/removal of observers, loose coupling, optimization, and
 * thread safety. Careful implementation and thorough testing can help ensure
 * the pattern functions as intended.
