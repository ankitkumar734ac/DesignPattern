/*
 * The Flyweight design pattern can be useful in solving several problems,
 * particularly when dealing with large amounts of objects with shared state.
 * Here are a few problem statements where the Flyweight pattern can be applied:
 * 
 * Memory optimization: When an application needs to create a large number of
 * objects that have significant memory overhead due to shared state, the
 * Flyweight pattern can help reduce memory usage by sharing the common state
 * among multiple objects.
 * 
 * Performance improvement: If creating and initializing objects is an expensive
 * operation, especially when involving resource-intensive tasks like disk I/O
 * or network operations, the Flyweight pattern can improve performance by
 * reusing existing objects instead of creating new ones.
 * 
 * Large-scale data sets: When working with massive data sets, such as in
 * database systems or data analytics applications, the Flyweight pattern can be
 * used to represent and manipulate data efficiently by sharing common data
 * across multiple instances.
 * 
 * Caching and caching invalidation: The Flyweight pattern can be employed in
 * caching scenarios, where frequently accessed data or results of expensive
 * computations are stored in memory to improve response times. Flyweight
 * objects can serve as cached entities that are shared and reused.
 * 
 * Text processing and formatting: In text processing applications, where text
 * with different formatting options (e.g., fonts, colors) needs to be
 * displayed, the Flyweight pattern can be used to share the common formatting
 * objects across multiple text instances, reducing the memory footprint and
 * improving performance.
 * 
 * Graphical user interfaces: Graphical applications often require rendering
 * multiple graphical objects, such as icons or images, on the screen. The
 * Flyweight pattern can be applied to share the common graphical data among
 * various objects, leading to memory efficiency and faster rendering.
 * 
 * It's important to note that the suitability of the Flyweight pattern depends
 * on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand. The
 * decision to apply the pattern should be based on careful analysis of the
 * trade-offs between memory usage, performance, and the complexity added by the
 * pattern implementation.
