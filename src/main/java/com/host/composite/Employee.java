/**
 * The Composite design pattern offers several advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore the pros and cons:
 * 
 * Pros of the Composite design pattern:
 * 
 * 1. Flexible object structure: The pattern allows you to create a tree-like structure where individual objects and groups of objects can be treated uniformly. This provides flexibility in organizing and representing complex hierarchical structures.
 * 2. Simplified client code: Clients can interact with the composite structure using a uniform interface. This simplifies the client code, as it doesn't need to differentiate between individual objects and composite objects. The client can treat them all as the same type.
 * 3. Recursive operations: The pattern enables recursive operations on the composite structure. For example, you can perform operations or apply algorithms on the entire structure or a specific branch of the tree.
 * 4. Easy to add new components: You can easily add new components to the composite structure without affecting the existing code. Both individual objects and composite objects can be added or removed seamlessly.
 * 
 * Cons of the Composite design pattern:
 * 
 * 1. Limited type safety: Since individual objects and composite objects are treated uniformly, the composite structure may not provide strong type safety. The client code may need to handle type checking or casting when working with specific operations that are only applicable to individual objects.
 * 2. Increased complexity: The pattern introduces additional complexity due to the recursive nature of the operations. It may be harder to understand and maintain compared to simpler patterns.
 * 3. Performance considerations: Depending on the implementation, there may be performance implications when working with large composite structures. For example, traversing the entire structure recursively may introduce overhead.
 * 4. Overly general solution: The Composite pattern may not be suitable for all scenarios. If the structure of the objects doesn't exhibit a hierarchical relationship or if the operations needed are specific to individual objects, using the Composite pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity.
 * 
 * It's important to carefully consider the specific requirements of your application before deciding to use the Composite design pattern. While it offers benefits like flexibility and simplified client code, it's also essential to weigh the potential drawbacks and evaluate whether they align with your design goals and constraints.
