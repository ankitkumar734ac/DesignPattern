/**
 * To avoid breaking the Facade pattern and ensure that the client code adheres
 * to the intended usage, you can take the following measures:
 * 
 * 1.Encapsulate the subsystem components: Make the subsystem components
 * (DVDPlayer, Projector, SurroundSoundSystem) private fields within the
 * HomeTheaterFacade class. This ensures that they are not directly accessible
 * from the client code.
 * 
 * 2.Provide only the necessary methods: Expose only the required methods
 * through the HomeTheaterFacade class. Avoid exposing the subsystem components
 * directly or providing unnecessary access to their methods.
 * 
 * 3.Document the usage guidelines: Clearly document the usage guidelines for
 * the client code, emphasizing that interactions with the subsystem should be
 * performed only through the HomeTheaterFacade class and that direct access or
 * modifications should be avoided.
 * 
 * By implementing these steps, you can discourage the client code from breaking
 * the Facade pattern and reinforce the desired usage of the facade.
