 * Certainly! Here's an example that illustrates a problem that can be solved
 * using the Facade pattern.
 * 
 * Problem: Imagine a scenario where you have a complex billing system
 * consisting of multiple interconnected components such as InvoiceGenerator,
 * PaymentGateway, and EmailService. The client code needs to perform the
 * following steps to generate an invoice, process a payment, and send an email
 * notification:
 * 
 * Generate an invoice using the InvoiceGenerator. Process the payment using the
 * PaymentGateway. Send an email notification using the EmailService. The client
 * code would have to interact directly with each component and handle the
 * interactions between them. This can lead to code duplication, increased
 * complexity, and a lack of encapsulation.
 *

/*
 * In this code, the client code directly interacts with the complex subsystem

 * and send an email notification.
 * 
 * However, this approach has some drawbacks compared to using the Facade
 * pattern. It can lead to increased complexity, code duplication, and a lack of
 * encapsulation. The client code needs to have knowledge of and handle the

 * to understand and maintain. Additionally, any changes to the subsystem
 * components would require modifications in multiple places throughout the
 * client code.

 * Solution using the Facade pattern: To simplify the usage of the billing

 * operations.

/*
 * In this example, the BillingSystemFacade acts as a simplified interface for

 * PaymentGateway, EmailService).
 * 
 * By using the Facade pattern, the client code is decoupled from the
 * complexities of the billing system. It can perform billing operations easily
 * without having to deal with the intricacies of generating an invoice,
 * processing a payment, and sending an email notification. The Facade pattern
 * promotes encapsulation, abstraction, and simplicity in the client code.
