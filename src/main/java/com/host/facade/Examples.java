            // Do something after successful authentication
        }

    public void sendEmail(String toAddress, String subject, String body) {
        emailSender.sendEmail(toAddress, subject, body);
    }
    
    // Other methods for different operations...

}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WebApplication webApp = new WebApplication();
        boolean isAuthenticated = webApp.loginUser("username", "password");
        if (isAuthenticated) {
            webApp.sendEmail("to@example.com", "Hello", "This is a test email");
        }
    }
}
In this example, we have three complex subsystems: UserAuthenticator, DatabaseConnector, and EmailSender. We create a WebApplication class that provides a unified interface for the application to access these subsystems. The WebApplication class creates instances of the subsystem classes and delegates the calls to them in the loginUser and sendEmail methods.

By using the WebApplication class, the client only needs to interact with a single class and doesn't need to know the details of how the user authentication, database connectivity, and email sending are implemented. The Facade encapsulates the complexity of the subsystems, providing a simpler and more convenient interface for the client.

Please note that in real-world scenarios, the complexity of the subsystems and their interactions can be much higher, and the Facade pattern can help to simplify their usage.

}
In this example, we have a complex subsystem consisting of three classes: InventoryService, PaymentService, and ShippingService. The OrderFacade class serves as the Facade that provides a simplified interface for placing orders in the e-commerce platform.

The OrderFacade class encapsulates the interactions with the subsystem. When the placeOrder method is called, it performs the following steps:

It checks the availability of the product using the InventoryService.
It processes the payment using the PaymentService.
It ships the order using the ShippingService.
It generates a unique order ID using a private method.
Finally, it informs the client that the order has been placed successfully.
By using the OrderFacade, the client doesn't need to directly interact with the individual services or know their internal details. The Facade provides a simple and unified interface to handle the complexities of the subsystem, making it easier to use and understand.

In a real-world scenario, the subsystem can involve more complex operations and interactions. The Facade pattern allows you to simplify the usage of such systems by providing a higher-level interface for common tasks or workflows.
