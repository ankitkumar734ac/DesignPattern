 *
 *         The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to
 *         separate the algorithm from the objects it operates on. It is useful
 *         when you have a hierarchy of objects and want to perform different
 *         operations on each object without modifying their classes.
 * 
 *         In Java, you can implement the Visitor pattern using the following
 *         steps:
 * 
 *         1. Define the element hierarchy: Create an interface or an abstract
 *         class that represents the elements in the hierarchy. This interface
 *         or abstract class should declare an abstract method for accepting
 *         visitors.

interface Element {
	void accept(Visitor visitor);
}

class ConcreteElementA implements Element {
	public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
		visitor.visitConcreteElementA(this);
	}
}

class ConcreteElementB implements Element {
	public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
		visitor.visitConcreteElementB(this);
	}
}

/**
 * 
 * 2. Define the visitor interface: Create an interface that declares visit
 * methods for each element type. Each visit method should accept a parameter of
 * the corresponding element type.
 */
interface Visitor {
	void visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA elementA);

	void visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB elementB);
}

/**
 * 
 * 3. Implement the visitor interface: Create concrete implementations of the
 * visitor interface. Each implementation should provide the algorithm for
 * visiting each element type.
 *
 */
class ConcreteVisitor implements Visitor {
	public void visitConcreteElementA(ConcreteElementA elementA) {
		// Implementation for visiting ConcreteElementA
	}

	public void visitConcreteElementB(ConcreteElementB elementB) {
		// Implementation for visiting ConcreteElementB
	}
}

/**
 * 4. Use the visitor pattern: Create instances of the concrete elements and the
 * concrete visitor. Then, call the accept method on each element, passing the
 * visitor as a parameter. java
 */
public class VisitorTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Element elementA = new ConcreteElementA();
		Element elementB = new ConcreteElementB();

		Visitor visitor = new ConcreteVisitor();

		elementA.accept(visitor);
		elementB.accept(visitor);
	}
}
/**
 * When the accept method is called on an element, it invokes the corresponding
 * visit method on the visitor. This way, the visitor can perform different
 * operations on each element without modifying their classes. The Visitor
 * pattern promotes extensibility by allowing you to add new operations by
 * creating new visitor implementations.
 * 
 * That's a basic example of implementing the Visitor pattern in Java. Remember
 * that the pattern can be more complex depending on your specific requirements
 * and the structure of your element hierarchy.

/**
 * The Visitor pattern offers several advantages and disadvantages, which are
 * summarized below:
 * 
 * Pros of the Visitor pattern:
 * 
 * Separation of concerns: The Visitor pattern helps separate the algorithm or
 * operations performed on the elements from their structure. It allows you to
 * define new operations without modifying the element classes, promoting the
 * Single Responsibility Principle.
 * 
 * Extensibility: The Visitor pattern makes it easy to add new operations to the
 * element hierarchy by creating new visitor implementations. You can introduce
 * new behaviors without modifying existing elements or visitors.
 * 
 * Open/Closed principle: The pattern follows the Open/Closed principle, as you
 * can introduce new visitors without modifying the existing elements. This
 * makes it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.
 * 
 * Centralized behavior: The Visitor pattern allows you to centralize related
 * operations or behaviors in a single visitor class. This can make the code
 * more organized and easier to understand, especially when dealing with complex
 * hierarchies.
 * 
 * Double dispatch: The Visitor pattern enables double dispatch, which means the
 * actual implementation to be called is determined dynamically based on the
 * types of both the element and the visitor. This allows for more flexible and
 * dynamic behavior.
 * 
 * Cons of the Visitor pattern:
 * 
 * Increased complexity: Implementing the Visitor pattern can increase the
 * overall complexity of the codebase, especially if the element hierarchy is
 * large or if there are frequent changes in the hierarchy or the visitor
 * interface. It may require adding new methods to the visitor interface and
 * updating all visitor implementations.
 * 
 * Tight coupling: The Visitor pattern can introduce tight coupling between the
 * visitor and element classes. Each new element added to the hierarchy will
 * require updating the visitor interface and all existing visitor
 * implementations. This can make the codebase more fragile and harder to
 * maintain.
 * 
 * Limited access to element internals: Visitors operate on elements through
 * their public interfaces, which means they have limited access to the internal
 * state and behavior of the elements. If an operation requires access to
 * private or protected members of an element, the Visitor pattern may not be
 * suitable.
 * 
 * Increased code duplication: If there are similar operations that need to be
 * performed on different elements, you may end up duplicating code across
 * different visitor implementations. This can lead to maintenance issues if the
 * shared logic needs to be updated or fixed.
 * 
 * Runtime overhead: The Visitor pattern introduces additional method calls and
 * dynamic dispatch, which can result in some runtime overhead compared to
 * direct method invocations.
 * 
 * Overall, the Visitor pattern can be a powerful tool for separating concerns
 * and adding new operations to an existing hierarchy without modifying its
 * classes. However, it should be used judiciously, considering the complexity
 * and trade-offs involved, especially in cases where the hierarchy is expected
 * to change frequently or where tight coupling needs to be avoided.
 */

/**
 * 
 * Identifying whether the Visitor pattern is used in a project can be done by
 * examining the structure and relationships between classes. Here are a few
 * indicators that suggest the presence of the Visitor pattern:
 * 
 * Hierarchy of elements: Look for a hierarchy of classes or interfaces
 * representing elements. These elements typically have a common base class or
 * interface and multiple concrete implementations.
 * 
 * Element-specific operations: Check if there are operations that are specific
 * to each element class but have a similar purpose. These operations might be
 * defined as abstract methods in the element base class or interface.
 * 
 * Visitor interface or base class: Look for an interface or abstract class that
 * defines visit methods for each element type. These visit methods should
 * accept the corresponding element type as a parameter.
 * 
 * Visitor implementations: Check for concrete visitor classes that implement
 * the visitor interface or extend the visitor base class. These classes should
 * provide specific implementations for each visit method, performing operations
 * on the corresponding elements.
 * 
 * Element acceptance of visitors: Examine the element classes to see if they
 * define an accept method that takes a visitor as a parameter. This method
 * typically calls the corresponding visit method on the visitor, passing itself
 * as an argument.
 * 
 * Usage of visitor objects: Look for instances of visitor classes being created
 * and passed to the accept method of elements.
 * 
 * By analyzing these aspects, you can determine whether the Visitor pattern is
 * being used in the project. However, keep in mind that the pattern might be
 * implemented in a slightly different way or may be combined with other design
 * patterns, so it's important to carefully analyze the code and its behavior to
 * confirm the usage of the Visitor pattern.
