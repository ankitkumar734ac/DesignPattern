/**
 * What types of problem that can we solve with help of Behavioral Design
 * Pattern? 
 * 
 * Behavioral design patterns are useful for solving a variety
 * of problems related to object communication, encapsulating algorithms,
 * managing state and responsibilities, and handling complex control flows. Here
 * are some types of problems that can be addressed using behavioral design
 * patterns:
 * 
 * 1. Communication and Coordination: Behavioral patterns help facilitate
 * effective communication and coordination between objects, allowing them to
 * interact and collaborate in a structured manner.
 * 
 * 2. Encapsulating Algorithms: These patterns provide a way to encapsulate
 * different algorithms and strategies, allowing them to be interchangeable and
 * selected dynamically at runtime.
 * 
 * 3. Managing State: Behavioral patterns help manage and encapsulate the state
 * of objects, allowing them to change their behavior based on different states
 * and ensuring the integrity of state transitions.
 * 
 * 4. Event Handling: Patterns such as Observer facilitate the handling of
 * events and notifications, allowing objects to react to changes in other
 * objects without tight coupling.
 * 
 * 5. Decoupling Objects: Behavioral patterns promote loose coupling between
 * objects, reducing dependencies and making the system more flexible and
 * maintainable.
 * 
 * 6. Controlling and Managing Complex Control Flows: Some behavioral patterns
 * help simplify and manage complex control flows by providing clear separation
 * of concerns and responsibilities.
 * 
 * 7. Undo and Redo Operations: Patterns like Command can be used to encapsulate
 * operations as objects, enabling the implementation of undo and redo
 * functionality.
 * 
 * 8. Iterating and Accessing Elements: Behavioral patterns like Iterator
 * provide a standardized way to iterate over and access elements of a
 * collection or aggregate object.
 * 
 * 9. Handling Requests and Responsibilities: Patterns like Chain of
 * Responsibility provide a way to handle and process requests in a chain,
 * allowing flexible handling and delegation of responsibilities.
 * 
 * 10. Adding Operations to Objects: Behavioral patterns like Visitor enable the
 * addition of new operations to an object structure without modifying the
 * structure's classes, promoting extensibility.
 * 
 * These are just some examples of the types of problems that can be addressed
 * using behavioral design patterns. Each pattern provides a specific solution
 * to a particular problem and can be applied in different contexts based on the
 * requirements of the system being developed.

/**
 * Behavioral design patterns can be used to solve a variety of problems in
 * software design, such as:
 * 
 * 1. Decoupling senders and receivers The chain of responsibility pattern allows a
 * sender to send a request to a chain of receivers. Each receiver in the chain
 * can handle the request, or it can pass the request on to the next receiver in
 * the chain. This pattern is useful for decoupling senders and receivers, and
 * it can be used to implement a variety of features, such as exception handling
 * and logging.
 * 
 * 2. Encapsulating behavior The command pattern encapsulates a request as an
 * object. This object can then be passed to other objects, which can execute
 * the request at a later time. The command pattern is useful for encapsulating
 * complex operations, and it can be used to implement undo/redo functionality
 * and event handling.
 * 
 * 3. Increasing flexibility The strategy pattern allows you to define a family of
 * algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects
 * interchangeable. This pattern is useful for making code more reusable, and it
 * can be used to implement features such as different sorting algorithms and
 * different search algorithms.
 * 
 * 4. Reducing complexity The template method pattern defines the skeleton of an
 * algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of
 * the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is useful for
 * making code more reusable, and it can be used to implement features such as
 * different sorting algorithms and different search algorithms.
 * 
 * 5. Improving readability The mediator pattern allows you to reduce chaotic
 * dependencies between objects. This pattern is useful for making code more
 * readable and maintainable, and it can be used to implement features such as
 * undo/redo functionality and event handling.
 * 
 * 6. Making code more reusable The iterator pattern allows you to iterate over a
 * collection of objects without exposing the underlying implementation of the
 * collection. This pattern is useful for making collections more reusable, and
 * it can be used to implement features such as pagination and searching.
 * 
 * 7. Defining a subscription mechanism The observer pattern allows you to define a
 * subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that
 * happen to the object they're observing. This pattern is useful for
 * implementing features such as notifications and event handling.
 * 
 * 8. Allowing an object to alter its behavior The state pattern allows an object
 * to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is useful
 * for implementing complex objects with multiple states, and it can be used to
 * implement features such as undo/redo functionality and validation.
 * 
 * 9. Saving and restoring the previous state of an object The memento pattern
 * allows you to save and restore the previous state of an object. This pattern
 * is useful for implementing undo/redo functionality and for debugging.
 * 
 * 10. Providing a mediator class The mediator pattern provides a mediator class
 * that handles all the interactions going on between different objects or
 * classes. This pattern also promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from
 * referring to each other explicitly.
 * 
 * 11. Making code more readable and maintainable The visitor pattern allows you to
 * separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. This pattern is
 * useful for making code more readable and maintainable, and it can be used to
 * implement features such as formatting and validation.
 * 
 * Behavioral design patterns are a powerful tool that can be used to solve a
 * variety of problems in software design. By understanding these patterns, you
 * can create more robust, maintainable, and reusable code.
