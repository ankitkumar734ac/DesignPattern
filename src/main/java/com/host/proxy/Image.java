/**
 * Here are some scenarios where you may want to use the Proxy design pattern:
 * 
 * 1.Remote Proxy: When working with distributed systems or remote services, a
 * proxy object can represent a remote object. The proxy handles the
 * communication with the remote object, such as establishing network
 * connections, serializing/deserializing data, and handling remote method
 * invocations.
 * 
 * 2.Virtual Proxy: If creating the real object is expensive or
 * resource-intensive, you can use a proxy to postpone its creation until it is
 * actually needed. The proxy can create the real object on-demand or when a
 * specific method is called. This approach is known as lazy initialization.
 * 
 * 3.Protection Proxy: A proxy can control access to the real object by
 * performing additional checks or providing security measures. For example, a
 * protection proxy can enforce access control rules or authenticate the client
 * before allowing access to sensitive operations.
 * 
 * 4.Logging/Debugging Proxy: A proxy can intercept method calls to the real
 * object and provide logging or debugging capabilities. It can log method
 * invocations, parameters, and results for monitoring or troubleshooting
 * purposes.
 * 
 * 5.Caching Proxy: A proxy can cache the results of expensive operations
 * performed by the real object. Subsequent requests can be served from the
 * cache, improving performance and reducing the load on the real object.
 * 
 * By introducing a proxy object, you can decouple the client from the complex
 * operations performed by the real object. The proxy provides a simplified
 * interface to the client while managing the underlying complexity behind the
 * scenes.
 * 
 * It's important to note that the usage of a proxy object depends on the
 * specific requirements of your application. You may not always need a proxy,
 * but when you encounter scenarios like those mentioned above, the Proxy design
 * pattern can be a useful solution.
